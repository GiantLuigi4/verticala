# Verticala

Infinite* build limit for BTA

(Infinite up to + or - 32000000 blocks, same as the world width)

Verticala is currently very heavily WIP, so don't expect it to work properly!

Contributions would be appreciated.

## Future Plans

- configurability
  - per world min and max height
  - choose per dimension if it should be applied
  - perhaps per dimension build limit?
- custom generators
  - having the nether be infinitely tall seems like it would be neat, but it also seems like it could be a nightmare to program
